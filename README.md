## My Process

- Set up a React app with TypeScript for type safety
- Managed global state with Redux Toolkit to handle country data and filters
- Connected to an Express backend API deployed on Railway
- Hosted frontend on Netlify for smooth deployment and CI/CD

## Built With

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Railway (backend deployment)
- Netlify (frontend deployment)

## What I Learned

- Improved my understanding of Redux for managing complex app state
- Gained experience integrating TypeScript in a React project
- Learned best practices for asynchronous data fetching with createAsyncThunk

## Continued Development

- Add search functionality for countries by name
- Implement better error handling and loading states
- Optimize for accessibility and keyboard navigation
